This is the first post of the blog after migrating to <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a>.

Before that I used many platforms for this blog. My first blog was written on Blogger.

After that I used WordPress, like any other blogger do, but it was a pain in the ass thing to host and maintain a WordPress blog and it was my first professional kinda blog.

Then I started using Ghost. It was a kinda modern type platform that uses Node.js, but it needed a propprt server to run.

After all now I'm using this Next.js thing. It's a fun thing to write a blog, making a template and other stuff on your own. And the best thing is it's very easy host and maintain this thing.
